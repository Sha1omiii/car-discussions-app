# Car Discussion App 
The Cars Discussion Web App is a full-stack application that allows car enthusiasts to debate and exchange information about their project/daily vehicles. Users can sign up, log in, make, amend, and delete blog posts about their vehicles, as well as see posts produced by other users. The software allows users to leave comments on each post and manages access and permissions through user identification.

## Why a Cars Discussion APP?
I chose to create a car-related app because I spend the most of my time online researching car forms and observing how individuals build their cars. Also, these forms have helped me answer some questions about my own project car, and I simply wanted to construct the site because I enjoy those forums and wanted to understand what goes into creating a complete stack site.

## Some Features Included in the App
- Authenticating users using session based authentication
- Users can manage their posts
> Create, edit, view, and delete car discussions or blogs I should say.
- A comment section and like feature for using to interact with other users posts
